# Changelog

## [0.0.0.6] - 2026-06-20

### Added

- **Wave 7.5 Tasks 1+2 — Risk gate safety wiring + orphan config rejection**: risk gate controls now enforce explicit safety limits before promotion, and the system rejects orphaned/misplaced `parameters.json` files that would previously silently merge.
- **Wave 7.5 Tasks 3+5+6 — Audit fixes**: Alertmanager webhook receiver hardened with proper field validation and HTTP status codes; field contract checks updated for the new valid-fields registry; calibration metadata preservation improved across auto-rollback scenarios.
- **Wave 7.5 finalization — Auto promotion events**: `AutoJudgePromoter` is now wired into the atlas scheduler; when an experiment is auto-promoted, an `EventPromotionRecorded` event is emitted and delivered to dashboard clients via SSE with a 50-event catch-up buffer.
- **`GET /api/dashboard/fetch-log` endpoint**: returns recent channel fetch events (`status`, `latency_ms`, `error`) from the persistent ring buffer, surfaced in the data-channel dashboard.

### Fixed

- `internal/alerting/webhook_handler.go` now returns `400 Bad Request` for malformed Alertmanager payloads and `422 Unprocessable Entity` for missing required fields instead of silently succeeding.
- `internal/monitoring/channel_health.go` now records per-channel failure reasons, so the fetch log and degraded-status panels show why a channel failed.

### Changed

- Risk gate panel UI (`web/static/js/components/risk-gate-panel.js`) now displays rejection reasons and inline safety override controls.
- Channel fetch log entries are now written by all CLI ingestion tools via `monitoring.RecordChannelFetch`, producing a single observability source for dashboard and alerting.

## [0.0.0.5] - 2026-06-17

### Breaking — Performance Report Field Renames + Threshold Config

**`AgentContribution.TotalReturn` → `AgentContribution.AggregateForwardReturn`** (JSON `total_return` → `aggregate_forward_return`).
**`RegimePerformance.TotalReturn` → `RegimePerformance.AggregateForwardReturn`** (same JSON rename).
**`AgentContribution.SharpeLike`**: `float64` → `*float64`. Now nullable when samples < `reporting.sharpe_min_samples` (default 5) or stdDev == 0. Frontend renders `"N/A"` for null.

These three fields exist in the `GET /api/performance-report` response payload (and the in-process `PerformanceReport` struct used by `cmd/judge-experiment`, `cmd/promote-baseline`, etc.). Frontend code must read the new field name and dereference `sharpe_like` defensively.

### Added — Cost-Adjusted Win-Rate Threshold

`reporting.win_rate_threshold` parameter (default 0.002, i.e. 0.2%). Win classification now requires `ForwardReturn > win_rate_threshold` instead of `ForwardReturn > 0`, covering transaction cost (~0.15% TW market) + slippage buffer. Configurable via `configs/parameters.json`. Affects `calculateTradeMetrics`, `calculateTopAgents`, and `calculateRegimeBreakdown`.

### Fixed — Fubon Proxy: Remove `FUBON_PROXY_URL` env override (IPv6 dual-stack root cause)

The recurring fubon channel failures (`dial tcp [::1]:8081: connect: connection refused`) were traced to a single design defect: `fubon_client.go` and `hybrid_provider.go` both read `os.Getenv("FUBON_PROXY_URL")`, which could override the safe hardcoded default `127.0.0.1:8081` with `localhost:8081` — resolved to IPv6 `[::1]` on macOS dual-stack systems while the Python fubon-proxy binds IPv4 only.

**Changes**:
- `internal/marketdata/fubon_client.go`: Replaced `os.Getenv("FUBON_PROXY_URL")` fallback in `newFubonClient()` with direct `fubonProxyBaseURL` constant. Removed unused `"os"` import.
- `internal/marketdata/hybrid_provider.go`: Removed both `os.Getenv("FUBON_PROXY_URL")` reads in `NewHybridProvider()`; always probes `127.0.0.1:8081` directly. Removed unused `"os"` and `"net/url"` imports.
- `.env_example`: Removed `FUBON_PROXY_URL` line and IPv6 warning comment (env override no longer exists).
- `.env.example`: Removed `FUBON_PROXY_URL` line (commented-out `localhost:8081` default).

This is the B-plan from PR #556 that was never implemented — the final root cause fix after 22 commits and 17+ PRs of layered defenses (circuit breaker, probe, auto-start, panic recovery, zombie kill) that never addressed the `.env` → env-override path.

### Added — `/api/dashboard/agent-names` endpoint

New endpoint serving the agent display-name registry from `configs/agents.json` as JSON. Single source of truth replacing the two competing static maps (`web/static/js/names.js` and `web/static/js/shared/constants.js`). Returns `{"agents": [{"id", "name", "skill", "layer"}, ...]}` or empty `{"agents": []}` when file is missing.

## [0.0.0.4] - 2026-06-15

### Fixed — Pipeline Data Visibility (6 commits, P0-P2)

**P0-C/D/E (20d1f56e) — frontend zero-value display**:
- `computePipelineSummary`: fallback `items` to `outcome_count` when summary missing.
- `formatDate`: filter zero-time (year<2000, NaN, year>9999), return `"-"`.
- `regimeLabel`: unify `"unknown"` → `"-"` across all 3 rendering paths.

**P1-A (ce4d89fc) — pipeline status banner**:
- `buildPipelineStatusBanner`: 5-status handler (`ok/degraded/minimal/no_session/error`).
- `is_fallback_session` as independent dimension.

**P1-B (366151b7) — OutcomeCount fallback**:
- `LoadSessions`: when `OutcomeCount==0`, derive from `recommendation_outcomes.jsonl` line count.
- Only overwrites zero — preserves summary's post-filter semantics.

**P1-C (0a553e4f) — backfill-summaries tool**:
- `cmd/backfill-summaries`: one-shot CLI for repairing orphan session directories.
- `internal/backfill/` package with `BackfillSummaries()` — idempotent, dry-run, never overwrites existing.
- 6 test cases covering orphan/existing/empty/mixed/noop scenarios.

**P2-A (36ac8a87) — RecordSessionSummary retry**:
- `recordSummaryWithRetry`: 3 attempts, 100ms linear backoff.
- Single chokepoint for all production summary writes.

**P2-B (4e4e97fa) — data_status sibling**:
- `parseSessionsList`: surface `data_status` as sibling field in array response.

## [0.0.0.3] - 2026-06-15

### Fixed
- `internal/live`: `TestOrderManager_Run_BrokerRejectsOrder` was flaky in `go test ./internal/live` — the assertion read the first event from the SubscribeAll channel, but `ChannelEventBus` dispatches handlers in their own goroutines, so `order.rejected` could arrive before `order.error`. The test now drains error events until it finds the expected `EventOrderError` (1 commit, 7906284b).

## [0.0.0.2] - 2026-06-14

### Added — Coverage Push (Stages 1-6 of functional-coverage-fix plan)

Total coverage: 57.6% → 61.1% across 7 commits on `feat/coverage-improvement`.

**Stage 1 (f1d6f712) — `feat(config,domain)`**:
- `internal/config`: restore `mergeFallbackPriceTargetsDefaults` helper to merge missing/partial `FallbackPriceTargets` entries from defaults.
- `internal/domain/recommendation`: add `Regime string` field to `RecommendationOutcome` with `json:"regime,omitempty"` tag.

**Stage 2 (34db5301) — `feat(monitoring,orchestrator)`**:
- `internal/monitoring/service`: per-regime grouping in `computeAgentRegimeBreakdown` (uses `o.Regime` with fallback to `defaultRegime`).
- `internal/orchestrator`: populate `RecommendationOutcome.Regime` in `buildSyntheticOutcomes` and `buildReplayOutcomes` (and corresponding `prism_executor.go`, `adversarial_executor.go`).

**Stage 3 (54b4442e) — `test(monitoring)`**:
- 9 test files in `internal/monitoring/` root (gateway_adapter, alert_api, alert_store, autohandler, channel_health, dashboard_api, metrics, risk_calibrator, new data_quality).
- Coverage: 50.1% → 69.7% (+19.6pp).

**Stage 4 (f62b7182) — `test(apigateway)`**:
- 15 test files covering 20 previously-zero `Fetch`/`HealthCheck`/`RateLimit` functions across 10 adapters.
- Coverage: 55.4% → 60.4% (+5.0pp). 24 funcs remain blocked pending marketdata HTTP-client injection (Stage 5c).

**Stage 5 (4e070c60) — `test(repository,shared,marketdata,apigateway)`**:
- `internal/repository`: 12.4% → 76.7% (+64.3pp). Added `pgPool` interface for testability (option C: Doer abstraction) + 637-line `postgres_unit_test.go` using pgx fake pool.
- `internal/domain/shared`: 28.4% → 100% (+71.6pp). 3 new test files covering 5 helpers.
- `internal/marketdata`: added `SetHTTPClient(c *http.Client)` testability hook to 10 providers (option A: least invasive). Coverage 49.1% → 53.2%.
- `internal/apigateway`: completed the 24 previously-blocked adapter funcs via new `adapter_http_fetch_test.go`. Coverage 60.4% → 79.0% (+18.6pp).

**Stage 5 follow-up (337f6647) — merge origin/main**:
- Integrated PR #526 (pipeline degraded status), #527 (Minimal/NoSession tests), #528 (sectorallocation module), #529 (wave4-cleanup).
- 4 conflicts resolved in favor of main per user priority instruction: `monitoring/service/pipeline.go` (semantically equivalent), `orchestrator/system.go` (API signature change `domain.Regime` → `string`), and 2 test files.
- Stage 2 regime population preserved at `buildSyntheticOutcomes` line 1442 and `buildReplayOutcomes` line 1492.

**Stage 6 (999b1fb6) — `test(monitoring/api)`**:
- 8 test files across 7 sub-packages (test-only scope, skipped `api/pipeline` per user priority):
  - `narrative` 8.4% → 90.8% (+82.4pp)
  - `macro` 10.0% → 70.0% (also fixed 2 pre-existing compile errors in `handlers_stub_test.go`)
  - `live` 20.2% → 88.2% (+68.0pp)
  - `industry` 46.6% → 77.7% (+31.1pp)
  - `tax` 47.4% → 80.8% (+33.4pp)
  - `dashboard` 49.6% → 70.9% (+21.3pp)
  - `shared` 98.8% → 98.8% (already at max, no change)

### Notes
- Pre-existing data races in `internal/live` (3 tests) are NOT caused by this push; they were introduced by `b39fb5b9 test(live): cover scheduler, store, twse_adapter, agent_runner, orchestrator, order_manager` which is on main.
- `gitnexus detect_changes` deferred: index stale (last indexed `891e724`); will refresh in follow-up.
- 7 commits pushed: `f1d6f712`, `34db5301`, `54b4442e`, `f62b7182`, `4e070c60`, `337f6647`, `999b1fb6`.

## [0.0.0.1] - 2026-06-13

### Fixed
- `internal/config`: merge `FallbackPriceTargets` defaults to prevent a panic when `_default` is missing and preserve custom per-stage overrides.

### Added
- `TestLoadParametersConfig_FallbackPriceTargetsDefaultsMerged` to verify `_default` and custom key merge behavior.
